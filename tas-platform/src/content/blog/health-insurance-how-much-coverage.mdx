## Why Health Insurance Is Non-Negotiable

Medical costs in India have been rising at 10-14% annually. A single hospitalization for a serious condition can easily cost Rs 5-15 lakh in a metro city, and critical treatments like cardiac surgery or cancer care can run into Rs 25 lakh or more. Without adequate health insurance, a medical emergency can wipe out years of savings and derail your financial plans entirely.

Health insurance is not just a tax-saving tool under Section 80D -- it is the foundation of a sound financial plan. It protects your wealth, your family, and your peace of mind.

## How Much Coverage Do You Need?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer, but here is a practical framework for determining the right coverage amount.

### Step 1: Consider Your City

Medical costs vary significantly across India. Treatment in metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai costs 30-50% more than in tier-2 cities. If you live in or are likely to seek treatment in a metro, you need higher coverage.

- **Metro cities**: Minimum Rs 10-15 lakh per person
- **Tier-2 cities**: Minimum Rs 5-10 lakh per person

### Step 2: Factor in Your Age and Health

As you age, your probability of hospitalization increases, and the cost of treatment typically rises. If you have pre-existing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders, you will need more comprehensive coverage. Consider:

- **Under 35, healthy**: Rs 5-10 lakh base cover may suffice
- **35-50, family**: Rs 10-20 lakh recommended
- **Above 50**: Rs 15-25 lakh or higher, especially with pre-existing conditions

### Step 3: Account for Family Size

If you are covering a family, you need to decide between individual plans for each member and a family floater plan that covers everyone under a single sum insured.

- **Family floater**: More affordable but shared limit. Good for young families with 2-3 members.
- **Individual plans**: Each member has their own full sum insured. Better when the family includes elderly parents.

### Step 4: Add a Super Top-Up

One of the smartest moves in health insurance planning is adding a super top-up policy. A super top-up activates once your base policy's threshold (deductible) is exhausted. For example:

- Base health insurance: Rs 10 lakh
- Super top-up: Rs 50 lakh with Rs 10 lakh deductible
- **Effective total coverage: Rs 60 lakh** at a fraction of the cost of a Rs 60 lakh base policy

Super top-ups typically cost Rs 3,000-8,000 per year for Rs 25-50 lakh of additional coverage, making them exceptional value.

## Key Features to Look for in a Health Insurance Plan

### Cashless Hospital Network

Ensure the insurer has a wide network of cashless hospitals in your city and in cities where you travel frequently. Cashless treatment means the insurer settles bills directly with the hospital, sparing you the stress of arranging funds during an emergency.

### No Room Rent Capping

Some policies limit room rent to a percentage of the sum insured (e.g., 1% of sum insured per day). This can lead to co-payment on the entire bill if you use a higher-category room. Choose plans with no room rent restrictions.

### Restoration Benefit

A restoration benefit replenishes your sum insured partially or fully if it gets exhausted during the policy year. This is particularly valuable for family floater plans where multiple claims in a year could deplete the limit.

### No Claim Bonus (NCB)

Most good policies increase your sum insured by 10-50% for every claim-free year. Over 5-6 years, your effective coverage can double without any increase in premium. Check the NCB terms and whether it resets partially or fully after a claim.

### Pre and Post Hospitalization Cover

Medical expenses do not stop at the hospital door. Diagnostic tests before admission and follow-up consultations after discharge add up. Ensure your policy covers at least 30 days of pre-hospitalization and 60 days of post-hospitalization expenses.

### Day Care Procedures

Modern medicine has made many procedures possible without 24-hour hospitalization -- cataract surgery, chemotherapy sessions, dialysis, and more. Ensure your policy covers a comprehensive list of day care procedures.

## Common Health Insurance Mistakes

### Buying Only the Employer's Group Cover

Employer-provided health insurance is a valuable benefit, but it should not be your only coverage. It typically ends when you leave the job, may not cover parents, and often has a lower sum insured. Always maintain a personal health insurance policy independent of your employer.

### Waiting Too Long to Buy

Health insurance premiums increase with age, and pre-existing conditions require waiting periods of 2-4 years before they are covered. The ideal time to buy is in your mid-twenties when you are healthy and premiums are lowest.

### Choosing Based on Premium Alone

The cheapest policy is rarely the best. A low-premium plan might have room rent caps, high co-payments, limited hospital networks, or poor claim settlement ratios. Always compare the claim settlement ratio (CSR) -- look for insurers with 90%+ CSR.

### Ignoring Critical Illness Cover

A regular health insurance policy covers hospitalization expenses, but critical illness cover provides a lump-sum payout on diagnosis of conditions like cancer, heart attack, or kidney failure. This lump sum covers non-medical expenses such as income loss, travel, or alternative treatments. Consider a separate critical illness policy of Rs 25-50 lakh.

### Not Disclosing Pre-Existing Conditions

Failing to disclose existing health conditions can lead to claim rejection when you need it most. Always be completely truthful in your application. The insurer will cover pre-existing conditions after the waiting period, but only if they were disclosed at the time of purchase.

## Tax Benefits of Health Insurance

Under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, you can claim deductions on health insurance premiums:

- **Self, spouse, and children**: Up to Rs 25,000 per year (Rs 50,000 if you are above 60)
- **Parents**: Additional Rs 25,000 (Rs 50,000 if parents are above 60)
- **Maximum combined deduction**: Rs 1,00,000 if both you and your parents are senior citizens

## Recommended Coverage Strategy

For a salaried professional in their 30s with a spouse and one child, here is a practical starting point:

1. **Family floater base plan**: Rs 10-15 lakh covering self, spouse, and child
2. **Super top-up**: Rs 25-50 lakh with a deductible matching your base plan
3. **Individual plan for parents**: Rs 5-10 lakh each (or a senior citizen-specific plan)
4. **Critical illness cover**: Rs 25-50 lakh for yourself

This combination provides robust coverage at an affordable annual premium and ensures that no single medical event can create a financial crisis.

## The Bottom Line

Health insurance is not an expense -- it is a financial safeguard. The right coverage amount depends on your city, age, family size, and health profile. Do not wait for a medical emergency to realize you are underinsured. Evaluate your needs today, and build a layered coverage strategy that protects your family and your wealth.
